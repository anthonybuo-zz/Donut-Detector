# Donut-Detector
For a grid where each cells has a random shade from white to black, a donut is defined as a black cell which has white cells above, below, and on its sides (not diagonal). These white cells then have black cells encircling them. Since the shade of each cell is randomly generated, the chance of finding a perfect donut is very low. This script chooses the best donut available.
