# Donut-Detector
For a grid where each cells has a random shade from white to black, a donut is defined as a white cell which has black cells above, below, and on its sides (not diagonal). These black cells have white cells in every adjacent spot. Since the shade of each cell is randomly generated, the chance of finding a perfect donut is very low. This script chooses the best donut available.
